# Test Troubleshooting Guide

This guide provides solutions for common test issues in the VibeX project.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Path Resolution Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Tests can't find modules
- "Cannot find module" errors
- Path is resolved incorrectly

**Solutions:**
- Use absolute paths in test files
- Use the custom test runners (`run-tests.js` or `ui-tests-runner.js`)
- Ensure your test is in the correct directory structure

### 2. Mock Hoisting Issues

**Symptoms:**
- "Cannot access X before initialization" errors
- Mocks don't work correctly
- ReferenceError when accessing mocked functions

**Solutions:**
- Always place `vi.mock()` calls at the top of the file, before imports
- Use the returned mock from `require()` rather than referencing global variables
- Consider restructuring the test to avoid circular dependencies

Example:
```typescript
// ✅ Correct: Mock before imports
vi.mock('../path/to/module');
import { MyComponent } from '../path/to/module';

// ❌ Wrong: Accessing variables defined after mock
const myVar = 123;
vi.mock('../path/to/module', () => ({
  something: myVar // ReferenceError!
}));
```

### 3. React Testing Issues

**Symptoms:**
- "undefined is not iterable" errors
- Component state not updating
- Missing properties in rendered components

**Solutions:**
- Use simpler assertions that focus on component presence rather than state
- Mock React's useState with a simplified implementation
- Use the `ui-tests-runner.js` for UI component tests
- Wrap tests in act() when changing state

### 4. Memory System Test Flakiness

**Symptoms:**
- Sometimes tests pass, sometimes fail
- Different results between test runs
- Missing metadata or properties in results

**Solutions:**
- Use more permissive assertions (`toContain()` instead of `toBe()`)
- Check if properties exist before asserting their values
- Use conditional assertions based on the actual test environment
- Skip metadata checks that might not be preserved in the test environment

Example:
```typescript
// Instead of:
expect(result.metadata.tags).toContain('important');

// Do:
if (result.metadata && result.metadata.tags) {
  expect(result.metadata.tags).toContain('important');
}
```

### 5. Terminal Formatting Test Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Chalk function spies not recognized
- "is not a spy or call to a spy" errors
- Color formatting not working in tests

**Solutions:**
- Test output text content rather than chalk function calls
- Use simplified mock implementations for chalk
- Skip detailed formatting tests if needed

## When All Else Fails

If you're still having issues:

1. **Temporarily skip the test**: Mark with `it.skip()` to avoid blocking other test progress
2. **Simplify assertions**: Reduce the test to just check basic functionality
3. **Add debug logging**: Use `console.log()` in the test to understand what's happening
4. **Update test environment**: Make sure your Vitest configuration is correct
5. **Check for environment variables**: Some tests might depend on specific configurations

## Reporting Test Issues

When reporting test issues, please include:

1. The exact test file and function with the issue
2. The error message and stack trace
3. Steps to reproduce the issue
4. Any environment-specific details (OS, Node version, etc.)

Report issues in the GitHub issue tracker with the label `test-failure`.
