# Vibex Testing Strategy

## Testing Philosophy

Our testing approach aims to be thorough and reliable across all components of the Vibex codebase:

1. **Complete Coverage**: Test every component and integration point
2. **Automated Test Runs**: Tests run automatically with every code change
3. **Multiple Testing Layers**: Unit, integration, end-to-end, and property-based testing
4. **Continuous Validation**: Validation scripts that can be run at any time
5. **Real-World Scenarios**: Tests that simulate actual usage patterns

## Testing Layers

### 1. Unit Tests

Unit tests verify individual components in isolation:

- Test individual functions and classes
- Mock all dependencies
- Focus on single responsibility units
- Verify edge cases and error handling

**Location**: `/tests/<module>/unit/`

### 2. Integration Tests

Integration tests verify components working together:

- Test interactions between multiple components
- Minimal mocking of internal dependencies
- Focus on contracts between components
- Verify data flows correctly between components

**Location**: `/tests/<module>/integration/`

### 3. End-to-End Tests

End-to-end tests verify complete workflows:

- Test from user input to final output
- Minimal mocking of external dependencies
- Focus on user-facing features
- Verify business requirements are met

**Location**: `/tests/<module>/e2e/`

### 4. Property-Based Tests

Property-based tests verify invariants regardless of inputs:

- Test with many randomly generated inputs
- Focus on mathematical properties and invariants
- Verify behavior consistency
- Catch edge cases automatically

**Location**: `/tests/<module>/property/`

## Module-Specific Testing Requirements

- Test user interactions
- Test accessibility
- Test responsive behavior

### Tools Module

- Test tool execution
- Test tool result handling
- Test tool error cases
- Test tool validation

## Test Automation

### Continuous Integration

We ensure tests run continuously:

1. **Pre-commit Hooks**: Run tests before each commit
2. **CI Pipeline**: Run tests on every push and pull request
3. **Scheduled Tests**: Run full test suite periodically

### Test Runners

We use multiple test runners for different scenarios:

1. **Jest**: Main test runner for unit and integration tests
2. **Playwright**: For end-to-end UI interaction tests
3. **Fast-check**: For property-based tests

## Test Coverage Requirements

We maintain strict coverage requirements:

1. **Line Coverage**: Minimum 90%
2. **Branch Coverage**: Minimum 85%
3. **Function Coverage**: Minimum 95%
4. **Complex Components**: 100% for core logic like token management

## Specialized Testing

### Snapshot Testing

Snapshot tests help detect unintended changes in output formats or UI components.

### Stress Testing

Stress tests verify the system under high load:

1. **Concurrency Testing**: Multiple simultaneous operations
2. **Resource Limit Testing**: Operating near memory/CPU limits
3. **Large Input Testing**: Handling exceptionally large inputs

### Mock Testing

Mock tests simulate external dependencies:

1. **API Mocks**: Simulate external APIs
2. **File System Mocks**: Simulate file operations
3. **Network Mocks**: Simulate network conditions

## Test Monitoring

We continuously monitor test health:

1. **Test Dashboard**: Shows test status and coverage trends
2. **Flaky Test Detection**: Identifies inconsistent tests
3. **Test Performance**: Monitors test execution time

## Test Execution

### Local Development

Developers should run tests locally:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests for specific module
npm test -- --testPathPattern="tests/ai"

# Run just unit tests for a module
npm test -- --testPathPattern="tests/ai/unit"

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Run validation script for a module
./tests/<module>/validate.sh
```

### CI Environment

Tests run automatically in CI:

1. **Pull Request**: Run affected tests
2. **Main Branch**: Run full test suite
3. **Release Branch**: Run full test suite with stress tests

## Test Driven Development (TDD)

We follow TDD principles for new features:

1. Write failing test first
2. Implement the minimal feature to make test pass
3. Refactor while keeping tests green

## Test Maintenance

Tests are treated as first-class citizens:

1. **Regular Reviews**: Test code is reviewed like production code
2. **Test Refactoring**: Tests are refactored when necessary
3. **Test Documentation**: Tests include clear documentation

## Automatic Testing During Refactoring

During refactoring, we utilize:

1. **Watch Mode**: Tests run automatically when files change
2. **Incremental Testing**: Run only tests for changed files
3. **Refactoring Validation**: Automatically validate architecture during refactoring

By maintaining this rigorous testing approach, we ensure the Vibex codebase remains robust, reliable, and easier to maintain and extend.
