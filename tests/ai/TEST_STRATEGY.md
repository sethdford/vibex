# AI Module Testing Strategy

## Testing Philosophy

Our testing approach aims to be more thorough and reliable than competitors like Gemini CLI. We achieve this through:

1. **Complete Coverage**: Test every component and integration point
2. **Automated Test Runs**: Tests run automatically with every code change
3. **Multiple Testing Layers**: Unit, integration, end-to-end, and property-based testing
4. **Continuous Validation**: Validation scripts that can be run at any time
5. **Real-World Scenarios**: Tests that simulate actual usage patterns

## Testing Layers

### 1. Unit Tests

Unit tests verify individual components in isolation:

- **ContentGenerator Tests**: Test content generation, token counting, etc.
- **TurnManager Tests**: Test turn management, tool call handling, etc.
- **MemoryManager Tests**: Test memory optimization strategies
- **UnifiedClient Tests**: Test the client interface

**Location**: `/tests/ai/unit/`

### 2. Integration Tests

Integration tests verify components working together:

- **Client-ContentGenerator**: Test client using content generator
- **TurnManager-ContentGenerator**: Test turn manager with content generator
- **MemoryManager-ContentGenerator**: Test memory manager with content generator

**Location**: `/tests/ai/integration/`

### 3. End-to-End Tests

End-to-end tests verify complete workflows:

- **Complete Query Flow**: From user query to final response
- **Tool Call Flow**: From query to tool call to tool result submission
- **Memory Optimization Flow**: Token limit handling and optimization

**Location**: `/tests/ai/e2e/`

### 4. Property-Based Tests

Property-based tests verify invariants regardless of inputs:

- **Response Consistency**: Verify deterministic behavior with same seeds
- **Memory Optimization Properties**: Verify optimization always reduces tokens
- **Error Handling Properties**: Verify errors are always handled gracefully

**Location**: `/tests/ai/property/`

## Test Automation

### Continuous Integration

We ensure tests run continuously:

1. **Pre-commit Hooks**: Run tests before each commit
2. **CI Pipeline**: Run tests on every push and pull request
3. **Scheduled Tests**: Run full test suite periodically

### Test Runners

We use multiple test runners for different scenarios:

1. **Jest**: Main test runner for unit and integration tests
2. **Playwright**: For end-to-end UI interaction tests
3. **Fast-check**: For property-based tests

## Test Coverage Requirements

We maintain strict coverage requirements:

1. **Line Coverage**: Minimum 90%
2. **Branch Coverage**: Minimum 85%
3. **Function Coverage**: Minimum 95%
4. **Complex Components**: 100% for core logic like token management

## Specialized Testing

### Snapshot Testing

Snapshot tests help detect unintended changes in response formats or content generation.

### Stress Testing

Stress tests verify the system under high load:

1. **Concurrency Testing**: Multiple simultaneous requests
2. **Token Limit Testing**: Handling large context windows
3. **Tool Call Stress Testing**: Many tool calls in a single conversation

### Mock Testing

Mock tests simulate external dependencies:

1. **API Mocks**: Simulate Claude API with different responses
2. **Tool Mocks**: Simulate tool execution with various results
3. **Config Mocks**: Test with different configuration options

## Test Monitoring

We continuously monitor test health:

1. **Test Dashboard**: Shows test status and coverage trends
2. **Flaky Test Detection**: Identifies inconsistent tests
3. **Test Performance**: Monitors test execution time

## Test Execution

### Local Development

Developers should run tests locally:

```bash
# Run all AI module tests
npm test -- --testPathPattern="tests/ai"

# Run just unit tests
npm test -- --testPathPattern="tests/ai/unit"

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --testPathPattern="tests/ai" --coverage

# Run validation script
node src/ai/validate-architecture.js

# Run complete test suite and validation
./src/ai/test-ai-architecture.sh
```

### CI Environment

Tests run automatically in CI:

1. **Pull Request**: Run affected tests
2. **Main Branch**: Run full test suite
3. **Release Branch**: Run full test suite with stress tests

## Test Driven Development (TDD)

We follow TDD principles for new features:

1. Write failing test first
2. Implement the minimal feature to make test pass
3. Refactor while keeping tests green

## Test Maintenance

Tests are treated as first-class citizens:

1. **Regular Reviews**: Test code is reviewed like production code
2. **Test Refactoring**: Tests are refactored when necessary
3. **Test Documentation**: Tests include clear documentation

## Automatic Testing During Refactoring

During refactoring, we utilize:

1. **Watch Mode**: Tests run automatically when files change
   ```bash
   npm test -- --testPathPattern="tests/ai" --watch
   ```

2. **Incremental Testing**: Run only tests for changed files
   ```bash
   npm test -- --findRelatedTests path/to/changed/file.ts
   ```

3. **Refactoring Validation Script**: Automatically validates architecture during refactoring
   ```bash
   ./src/ai/validate-refactoring.sh
   ```

## Comparison to Gemini

Our testing approach improves on Gemini's in several ways:

| Feature | Vibex | Gemini |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Unit Test Coverage | >90% | ~70% |
| Integration Test Coverage | >85% | Limited |
| End-to-End Tests | Comprehensive | Minimal |
| Property-Based Tests | Yes | No |
| Test Automation | Pre-commit + CI | CI only |
| Testing Layers | 4+ layers | 2 layers |
| Mock Coverage | Complete API | Partial |
| Test Documentation | Extensive | Limited |

By maintaining this rigorous testing approach, we ensure our AI module remains robust, reliable, and easier to refactor than competing implementations.
