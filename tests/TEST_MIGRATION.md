# Test Migration Results

We've successfully migrated the VibeX test suite to follow Gemini CLI's clean architecture principles:

## Completed Actions

1. **Converted Jest to Vitest**
   - Updated all test files to use Vitest syntax
   - Fixed module mocking issues for fs/promises, chalk, and other dependencies
   - Created proper test setup files

2. **Reorganized Test Files**
   - Moved unit tests alongside their source files (53 tests moved to src/)
   - Organized integration tests in tests/integration/ directory
   - Organized E2E tests in tests/e2e/ directory
   - Organized property tests in tests/property/ directory

3. **Fixed Path and Import Issues**
   - Created proper mock files in __mocks__ directories
   - Preserved backup copies of all tests before moving

## Next Steps

1. **Update Import Paths in Test Files**
   - Review files in tests-needing-import-review.txt
   - Fix any broken imports due to file reorganization

2. **Address Test Failures**
   - Some tests may need updates to reflect new structure
   - Focus first on fixing critical test failures

3. **Implement Clean Architecture Patterns**
   - Organize source code to follow core/services/infrastructure layers
   - Enforce proper dependency direction (UI → Application Logic → Domain)

4. **Incrementally Update Additional Tests**
   - Review and fix any remaining test issues
   - Ensure all tests are passing in the new structure

## Migration Stats

- Unit tests moved to src/: 53
- Tests in tests/ directory: 87
- Total tests migrated to use Vitest: 140

## Using Clean Architecture Structure

For future development, follow these patterns:

1. **Core Domain Layer**
   - Place in src/core/
   - Contains domain entities and business logic

2. **Application Layer**
   - Place in src/services/
   - Implements use cases that orchestrate domain models

3. **Infrastructure Layer**
   - Place in src/infrastructure/
   - Handles integration with external systems

4. **UI Layer**
   - Place in src/ui/
   - Responsible for presentation logic

These changes align our project structure with modern clean architecture principles and make the codebase more maintainable and testable.
