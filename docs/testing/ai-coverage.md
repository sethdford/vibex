## Coverage by Test Type

| Test Type         | Files         | Coverage Contribution |
|-------------------|---------------|----------------------|
| Unit Tests        | 12            | 65%                  |
| Integration Tests | 4             | 20%                  |
| E2E Tests         | 3             | 10%                  |
| Property Tests    | 3             | 5%                   |

## High-Priority Coverage Gaps

1. **Error Handling Scenarios**
   - Network errors during streaming
   - Rate limit handling
   - Error recovery mechanisms

2. **Memory Optimization Edge Cases**
   - Very large context windows
   - Empty message handling
   - Messages with non-text content

3. **Tool Call Handling**
   - Multiple sequential tool calls
   - Tool call timeout scenarios
   - Invalid tool results

## Medium-Priority Coverage Gaps

1. **Configuration Options**
   - Custom model configurations
   - Advanced streaming options
   - Custom memory strategies

2. **Performance Characteristics**
   - High-volume requests
   - Concurrent operations
   - Memory usage patterns

## Test Coverage Improvement Plan

### Phase 1: Fill Critical Gaps

1. Add unit tests for error handling in ContentGenerator
2. Add integration tests for tool call error scenarios
3. Add E2E tests for memory optimization with large contexts
4. Add property tests for error recovery guarantees

### Phase 2: Enhance Existing Coverage

1. Add boundary condition tests for all numeric parameters
2. Add more variations of configuration options tests
3. Add performance benchmark tests

### Phase 3: Add Advanced Test Types

1. Add mutation testing
2. Add stress testing under load
3. Add snapshot tests for response formats

## Monitoring Coverage

We automatically monitor test coverage on all PRs and reject any changes that decrease coverage below our thresholds:

- Line Coverage: Minimum 90%
- Branch Coverage: Minimum 85% 
- Function Coverage: Minimum 95%
