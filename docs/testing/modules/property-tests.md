# Property-Based Tests for AI Module

This directory contains property-based tests that verify invariants of the AI module regardless of inputs.

## Test Scope

- **Response Consistency**: Verify deterministic behavior with same seeds
- **Memory Optimization Properties**: Verify optimization always reduces tokens
- **Error Handling Properties**: Verify errors are always handled gracefully

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all property-based tests
npm test -- --testPathPattern="tests/ai/property"

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --testPathPattern="tests/ai/property" --coverage
```

## Writing Property-Based Tests

Property-based tests should use libraries like fast-check to generate random inputs and verify that certain properties hold true for all valid inputs.
