The UI enhancements will use a combination of React Context for global state and local component state for UI-specific concerns:

1. **ToolExecutionContext**: Manages tool execution state, history, and feedback
2. **WorkflowContext**: Manages workflow definition, execution state, and history
3. **MonitoringContext**: Provides performance metrics and system health information
4. **InterfaceContext**: Manages interface mode selection and configuration

### Integration with Tool System

The UI components will integrate with the Clean Architecture tool system through:

1. **Tool Service Adapters**: Connect UI components to underlying tool services
2. **Event-based Updates**: Subscribe to tool execution events for real-time updates
