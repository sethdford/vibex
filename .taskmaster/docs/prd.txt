# Product Requirements Document: Gemini CLI Parity & Superiority Initiative

## Executive Summary

**Mission**: Transform VibeX from 20% feature parity to 120% superiority over Gemini CLI, establishing it as the definitive next-generation AI CLI tool.

**Current Reality**: Despite superior performance (6x faster startup, 4x smaller bundle) and modern architecture, VibeX lacks 80% of Gemini CLI's core infrastructure capabilities.

**Scope**: 500-1000 TODOs across 12 major subsystems requiring 4-7 months of dedicated development.

**Business Impact**: 
- Establish market leadership in AI CLI tools
- Obsolete Gemini CLI through superior capabilities + performance
- Create the foundation for enterprise AI tooling dominance
- Enable advanced workflows impossible with current tools

## Problem Analysis

### Current State Assessment

**VibeX Strengths (20% Parity):**
- ✅ **Performance**: 6x faster startup (32ms vs 200ms), 4x smaller bundle
- ✅ **UI/UX**: Modern React architecture, streaming responses, themes
- ✅ **Basic AI**: Claude 4 Sonnet integration with token management
- ✅ **Architecture**: Clean TypeScript/ESM codebase, modular design

**Critical Gaps (80% Missing):**
- ❌ **Hierarchical Context System**: No global/project/subdirectory context management
- ❌ **Conversation State Management**: No branching, saving, or resuming conversations
- ❌ **Checkpointing System**: No Git snapshots, rollback, or safety nets
- ❌ **Extension System**: No MCP integration or plugin architecture
- ❌ **Production Tools**: Missing 80% of Gemini CLI's tool ecosystem

### Competitive Analysis

**Gemini CLI Capabilities:**
- 62,423 lines across 400+ files
